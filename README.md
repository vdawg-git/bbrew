# Catbbrew

## Brew your own flavor

An awesome color theme creator using the [Catppuccin](https://github.com/catppuccin/catppuccin) system.

## Features

- It's awesome
- Supports everything Catppuccin supports (a lot)
- Better Okhsl color picker for constant lightness
- Smooth workflow: Click on codeblocks to change their color direclty
- Editable preview code
- Create a familiar setup by changing the font
- Presets (Todo)
- Save your progress in the history and have different versions (Todo)

Ideas for the future:

- Nice random palette generator
  - Monochrome, Duotone, Tria, Colorful
  - Use base color(s)
  - Settings: Warm <-> Cool, Gray <-> Colorful
- Harmonize colors
- Text block preview (only see a text skeleton to focus on the colors)
- More IDE UI elements (maybe a statusline?)

Make it more awesome. Contributions are welcome!
